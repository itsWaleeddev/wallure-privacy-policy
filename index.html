<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 6, 2025</p>

  <p><em>Wallure â€“ Free HD Wallpapers</em> (hereinafter referred to as the "Application") is provided by <strong>Waleed Ahmad Apps</strong> (hereinafter referred to as the "Service Provider") as an ad-supported service.</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any information related to your use of the Wallure app.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The Application does not collect, store, or process any personal user data. There is no account system, no user authentication, and no backend or database connected to this app. The Application functions entirely on-device and does not require users to share any personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or location data.</p>

  <p>However, the Application uses third-party services that may collect limited information for functionality and analytics purposes (e.g., ad display). These services operate under their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Application uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Play Services</li>
    <li>AdMob â€“ for displaying ads</li>
    <li>Pixabay API â€“ for fetching wallpaper images</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We encourage users to review the privacy policies of these providers to understand how they handle user data.<br/>
  As the developer, we have applied content filters in AdMob to prevent inappropriate or sensitive ad categories (e.g. nudity, music, etc.) in accordance with our values.</p>

  <h2>3. App Features and Functionality</h2>
  <p>Wallure is a wallpaper browsing application that allows users to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Browse and download free HD wallpapers</li>
    <li>Explore content from 20+ categories</li>
    <li>Use the Favorites feature to bookmark wallpapers</li>
    <li>Search for wallpapers using keywords</li>
    <li>View wallpapers using lock screen and home screen previews</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Application does not set wallpapers automatically. Users are prompted to open their gallery to set wallpapers manually.</p>

  <h2>4. Internet Usage</h2>
  <p>An active internet connection is required to fetch wallpapers from the Pixabay API and to display ads via AdMob. Users are responsible for any mobile data charges incurred.</p>

  <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
  <p>The Application itself does not use cookies. However, integrated third-party services such as AdMob may use cookies or similar technologies for their functionality.</p>

  <h2>6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Application is not specifically directed toward children under the age of 13. However, it contains no content that is inappropriate for children and may be used safely by users of all ages. No personal data is collected from any users.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>Since no user data is collected or stored, there is minimal risk to user privacy. However, we advise users not to use rooted or jailbroken devices, as they may compromise system and app security.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page and are effective immediately after posting.</p>

</head>
<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 6, 2025</p>

  <p><em>Wallure â€“ Free HD Wallpapers</em> (hereinafter referred to as the "Application") is provided by <strong>Waleed Ahmad Apps</strong> (hereinafter referred to as the "Service Provider") as an ad-supported service.</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any information related to your use of the Wallure app.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The Application does not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable user data. There is no account system, no user authentication, and no backend or database connected to this app. The Application functions entirely on-device and does not require users to provide personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or exact location.</p>

  <p>However, the Application uses third-party services that may collect limited, non-personal data for advertising, analytics, and functionality purposes. These services operate under their own privacy policies, and data may be used to improve service performance, prevent fraud, and deliver ads (non-personalized only).</p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Application uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Play Services</li>
    <li>AdMob â€“ for displaying banner, interstitial, and app open ads</li>
    <li>Pixabay API â€“ for fetching wallpaper images</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These services may collect information such as device type, OS version, Advertising ID, IP address, and ad interaction data. No personalized ads are served, and users are shown non-personalized ads only. Content filters are applied in AdMob to block inappropriate or sensitive categories in line with our values.</p>

  <h2>3. App Features and Functionality</h2>
  <p>Wallure is a wallpaper browsing application that allows users to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Browse and download free HD wallpapers</li>
    <li>Explore wallpapers from various categories</li>
    <li>Bookmark favorites</li>
    <li>Search for wallpapers using keywords</li>
    <li>Preview wallpapers before saving</li>
    <li>Set wallpapers using the Android default wallpaper picker</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>4. Data Permissions</h2>
  <p>When saving a wallpaper, the Application requests permission to access the deviceâ€™s media storage (photos). This is used only for saving the selected image to the user's gallery when they choose to download it. If permission is not granted, saving functionality will be disabled, but the app remains otherwise usable. The Application also uses the Android default wallpaper picker for setting wallpapers, which does not collect or store personal data.</p>

  <h2>5. Internet Usage</h2>
  <p>An active internet connection is required to fetch wallpapers from the Pixabay API and to display ads via AdMob. Users are responsible for any data charges incurred through internet usage.</p>

  <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>The Application itself does not use cookies. However, integrated third-party services such as AdMob may use cookies or similar tracking technologies to provide non-personalized ads and measure ad performance.</p>

  <h2>7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Application is not directed toward children under the age of 13. While the app does not collect any personal information, it is advised that children use the app under parental guidance. All ads and content are filtered to avoid sensitive categories.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>Since no personal user data is collected or stored, the risk to user privacy is minimal. However, users are advised not to use rooted or jailbroken devices, as these can compromise both device and app security.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and are effective immediately upon posting.</p>
